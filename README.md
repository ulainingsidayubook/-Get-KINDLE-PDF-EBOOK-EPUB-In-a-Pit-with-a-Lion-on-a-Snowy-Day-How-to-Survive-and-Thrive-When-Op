Your greatest regret at the end of your life will be the lions you didn't chase. You will look back longingly on risks not taken, opportunities not seized, and dreams not pursued. Stop running away from what scares you most and start chasing the God-ordained opportunities that cross your path. In a Pit with a Lion on a Snowy Day is inspired by one of the most obscure yet courageous acts recorded in Scripture, a blessed and audacious act that left no regrets: ‚ÄúBenaiah chased a lion down into a pit. Then, despite the snow and slippery ground, he caught the lion

Title: Ineededthis
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2017
Review: This is NOT a book to read before bed.... it is a cup of coffee in itself and packs just enough power each day to move you forward for Christ and for others you love. It IS repetitive. It NEEDS to be.... My eyes are open.....We are dead in our pews , dead in our relationships and we have been dead so long, we dont even see it or know how to come alive anymore. With the mantra of chasing lions, slowly I began to awaken. Now, I am a fool, a child AND a lion chaser. Be warned... you could be changed.

Title: Anencouragingbookthatwillhelpyoutoseeopportunityinlifesmostdifficultchallenges
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2017
Review: Mark Batterson‚Äôs ‚ÄúIn a Pit With A Lion On a Snowy Day‚Äù is a challenging and encouraging book based on the story of Benaiah in the Old Testament. There is very little in the bible about Benaiah. We know that eventually he became one of David‚Äôs bodyguards and at some point was leader of part of David‚Äôs army. We also know that all of that happened after one snowy day, he chased a lion into a pit and killed it. Batterson uses that brief story as his encouragement to Christians to be ‚Äúlion chasers‚Äù. He proposes in this book a statement that will stick with me for quite some time: ‚ÄúWhat if the life you want, and the life God wants for you, is hiding right now in your biggest problem, your worst failure?‚ÄùThis is the second book that I‚Äôve read by Batterson. And while I didn‚Äôt enjoy this one quite as much as ‚ÄúIF‚Äù, this is still very much a book worth reading. Batterson has the gift of encouragement and that gift is felt as he challenges the reader to be completely unafraid to not only take on the seemingly impossible challenges this life sometimes throws at us‚Ä¶..but to also change the way we see those challenges. Batterson suggests that in each of life‚Äôs most difficult moments, is an opportunity for God to work in our situation for our good and His glory.As with the other Batterson book I read, this one is full of brilliant quotes and bulletin board material. I‚Äôd keep the highlighter ready. You‚Äôre going to want to take notes.Well done.

Title: DreamsAreGodGiven
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2017
Review: I believe this book was a God send in my life. As I was reading it I realized that the dreams of doing something even bigger than I could imagine for the kingdom of God and pursuing after personal dreams is something that God has put in me and that I should go after. I had almost got to the point where I believed I was not supposed to try to do anything new. Be satisfied with being on a level plane. Not moving forward. Feeling almost guilty for having BIG Dreams. That's what the enemy would all of us to believe. Reading this book has renewed a passion in me to go for the God given dreams. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to start something or be apart of something beyond their biggest dreams and imagination. Thanks Mark Batterson for allowing God to use you in writing this encouraging book.

Title: INSPIRINGaudaciousconvicting
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2017
Review: This book was recommended by someone I'd known for over 30 years.. my ex- husband... soon to be my forever husband. This book brought conviction and assurance that our dream after 26 years of marriage, and separated by a never imagined, unconsciously real, yet fascinating dream... to chase a lion of reconciliation after 4 years of separation. YES, God will honor your "God Sized" dream. This book was written for US in God's timing and it is written for you. Read it and you will see why... and you'll never be able to return to status quo!!!

Title: Inspiring
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2018
Review: This is a thought-provoking, energetic and inspiring book. It challenges Christians to chase after their dreams and, with faith in God, to go out on a limb and live those dreams He has given us. The key word and theme in the book is faith. We are to have faith in a God who is bigger than we can imagine and can accomplish and fulfill God-sized dreams greater than we can comprehend. Batterson is a wonderful, God-inspired writer who keeps the focus on God. His writing flows well and the chapters are broken up into sections that work well as a morning devotional. It is exhilarating, inspiring reading. Read the book, then go chase your lions!

Title: Greatreadtodiscoverberemindedorexplore
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2017
Review: There are times in life when you hear about a book, or it comes across your path, and the timing is just RIGHT. "In a Pit with a Lion on a Snowy Day" crossed my path at just that time. Mark Batterson takes you down a path of facing fear, looking at what playing "small" creates-or doesn't create and how to live to our fullest "God given talents". As that statement reads, God has given each of us talents and if we do not explore what they are, and utilize all He has given us, we are not truly living up to what we have been created for. And don't miss "Chase the Lion" which is Mark's continuation of Snow Day.

Review: This is THE book that will make you throw caution to the wind and really start living your life. I never would have thought that a book could have such an impact.Mark uses so many great stories to weave together a dream that we all need to pursue. A dream weaver is what he is.Start chasing lions. Start looking for lions to chase. If your dreams don‚Äôt scare you, they are not big enough.
